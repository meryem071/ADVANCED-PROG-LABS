# Advanced Programming — Labs

Course labs (Java, Maven). Each lab is a self-contained Maven project with its
own `README.md`, starter code, tests (`mvnw test`) and wrapper (`mvnw.cmd`).

## Labs

| Lab | Topic | Folder |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lab 1 | Metaprogramming: introspection + annotations | [`lab1/`](lab1/) |
| Lab 2 | Generics: generic classes, bounds, wildcards | [`lab2/`](lab2/) |

Open the lab folder itself in VS Code (where `pom.xml` is), not this root.
Requires JDK 11+ (lab2) / 17+ (lab1) and the `Extension Pack for Java`. Run tests with
`.\mvnw.cmd test` (Windows) or `./mvnw test` (Linux/Mac).

## Lectures

PDF slides live in [`lectures/`](lectures/) (uploaded separately).

## For instructors

`lab1-sol/`, `lab2-sol/` (reference solutions) are intentionally **not
committed** — see `.gitignore`. Keep them local, never push them to the
student-facing repo.
